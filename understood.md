# 🧠 Project Understanding: Fsociety Cybersecurity Platform

I have reviewed the provided context and files. Here is my comprehensive understanding of the project's current state and goals.

## 🚀 Project Overview
**Fsociety** is an advanced cybersecurity scanning and analysis platform designed to provide modular security tools through a unified API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Current)
- **Backend Framework**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (Planned/In-progress)
- **Data Storage**: In-memory Python dictionaries (using `TempDb` in `Auth_Model.py`) - No external database used yet.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Access and Refresh tokens.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Structure
The project follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **Routers (`/routers`)**: Defines API endpoints for different modules (Auth, User, Admin, Scan, Security, File).
- **Services (`/services`)**: Contains the business logic for each module.
- **Models (`/models`)**: Defines Pydantic schemas for request/response validation and the temporary database structure.
- **Utilities (`/utils`)**: Shared tools for networking (DNS, WHOIS), security (SSRF Guard), and rate limiting.
- **Configuration (`/config`)**: App-wide settings and constants.

## 🔍 Key Feature Modules

### 1. Authentication & Identity
- Standard Signup/Login flow.
- Role-based access control (User and Admin).
- Token refresh mechanism and secure logout.

### 2. Scanning Tools
- **Network**: DNS lookup, WHOIS, IP geolocation, Port scanning.
- **Domain**: Comprehensive domain analysis and subdomain discovery.
- **Security**: SSL/TLS certificate analysis, HTTP header security checks.

### 3. Safety & Intelligence
- **Phishing Detection**: URL reputation analysis.
- **File Analysis**: Hash-based malware detection and file type validation.
- **SSRF Protection**: Prevents the scanner from being used against internal infrastructure.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects endpoints from abuse.

## 🎯 Current Focus
The focus is currently on the **Backend** implementation, ensuring all security tools and management endpoints are functional and robust before being integrated with the frontend.
